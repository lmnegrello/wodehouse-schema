# Wodehouse Book Schema

A JSON Schema for cataloguing bibliographic records of books — beginning, fittingly, with the charming works of P.G. Wodehouse.

Current fields include:

- `title` — The title of the book  
- `author` — The author's full name  
- `lcc` — Library of Congress classification number  
- `cat` — Resource type (e.g., book)
